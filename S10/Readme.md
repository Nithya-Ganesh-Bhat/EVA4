Advance concepts, Training and learning rates

In this session, we learned

•	To add cutout to images through albumentation.

•	To find optimum learning rate of model through LR curve.

•	Implemented ReduceLROnPlateau.

•	Ran the model for 50 epochs.

•	Used SDG with momentum

•	Highest test accuracy we acheived : 90.71 %

•	Plotted grad cam images for 25 mis-classified images.
